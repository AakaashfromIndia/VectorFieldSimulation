This project is an interactive computational tool designed to help users visualize, manipulate, and analyze two-dimensional vector fields. At its core, it combines mathematical concepts from vector calculus with intuitive graphical interaction, making abstract field properties accessible and visually engaging.

A vector field in two dimensions assigns a vector (with both magnitude and direction) to every point in a plane. Mathematically, such a field is often written as:

where U(x,y) and V(x,y) are the field's components in the x and y directions, respectively.

# Initial Field Construction
The project begins by letting the user define a uniform vector field. This means every point in the grid has the same vector, determined by user-supplied constants a and b. A key feature is the ability to draw arrows directly onto the field. Each arrow is mathematically interpreted as a localized perturbationâ€”an influence that modifies the field in its vicinity. When a user draws an arrow from 
(x0,y0) to (x1,y1), it represents a vector influence with direction and strength proportional to the arrow's length and orientation.

The effect of each arrow is not limited to a single point; instead, it decays with distance from its origin, affecting the entire field but most strongly near where it was drawn. This is modeled as:

The resultant field is the sum of the initial uniform field and the cumulative effects of all user-drawn arrows:

# Field Analysis: Gradient, Divergence, and Curl
The tool offers further insight by enabling overlays of key vector calculus properties:
- Gradient Magnitude: Measures how rapidly the field changes in space. It is computed as the root of the sum of squares of all spatial derivatives of the field components.
- Divergence: Indicates the presence of sources (where field lines spread out) or sinks (where they converge)
- Curl: Measures the tendency of the field to induce rotation around a point:
 
These properties are computed numerically using finite differences and visualized as color overlays, making abstract mathematical concepts tangible.
